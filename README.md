JavaScript Procedural RPG Generator
==========================================

Procedurally generated RPG world. Takes a random # seed and generates land, sea, rivers, etc. Places some starting 'units' and the world evolves over time. 2D top-down style turn-based RPG.
Still in development, this version shows the map generator based on voronoi diagrams, some towns support and basic units.
