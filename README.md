JavaScript Procedural WWII Simulator
==========================================

Procedurally generated map simulates the
nations on a randomly created map that
existed in the interwar period of the 20th
century.

Currently the map generation is implemented
in part.  Rivers need to be corrected, however
a proper implementation requires a pathfinding
algorithm.

Units can be manufactured in cities, factories
add more manufacturing (per turn) capacity
to the city.

Pseudo-real world nations of the time period
will be implemented, currently only Anglo-ish
and Franco-ish templates are in place. All
other nations are represented by a random
"tribal nation".
